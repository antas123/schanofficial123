      <h2>"HOLA PEOPLE"</h2>
      <p>I was born on third of April, 2001 in Kanpur , but I was brought up in various cities of Delhi ncr . I did my Kindergarten schooling from
      St. Memorial School , Gurugram , after that my family shifted to Greater Noida and have been dwelling there since then. I got admitted in St Joseph's Senior
    Secondary School . I used to perform quite well in academics . After class 6 my parents got me admitted in Ryan International School , I still don't know why.
  So I completed my schooling from ryan in 2019 .  </p>

  <p>In class 11th I joined a coaching institute for JEE but could not make into list of any exams in my first attempt.
  Took a drop , covid hits , tried utilizing the extra time period to firm my grip over chemistry but I messed up my JEE again due to that bloody chemistry
got a decent rank in UPSEE and got admittedin in IET LUCKNOW.</p>
<p>I sored 95% in my class 10th and 90% in class 12th , currently I am pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology from IET LUCKNOW.</p>

history and mythology. I believe that i'm a good cook , yeah! I love cooking , it really proves a stress buster for me everytime. Though i'm not a sporty
person enoufg, but I like paying badminton and enjoy playing kabaddi and kho-kho .</p>
